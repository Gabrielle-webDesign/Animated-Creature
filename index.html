        <p><strong>JACKO PHANTOM</strong> is a whimsical little creature.<br><br>A ghost boy donned in a bleached onesie and headed with a freshly carved pumpkin.<br><br>This little trickster still enjoys roaming the foggy streets and cold fields on crescent moon nights, a single roman candle to light his way, gathering candy to satisfy his still very alive sweet tooth. That purple sack with a yellow pie is bottomless.<br><br>How did Jacko Phantom get this way? No one knows, but everyone knows that if you give him a cherry lolipop, his all-time favorite candy, he'll make his head float for you! <br><br><em>"A literal trick for a treat!"</em> Oh, that little Jacko Phantom. </p>
